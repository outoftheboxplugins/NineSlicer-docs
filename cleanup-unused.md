# What is the Cleanup Operation

The `Cleanup operation` (also known as `Cleanup unused`) is the process by which the plugin collects the [**unused**](index#what-is-consider-unused) from the input assets and creates a [Cleanup report](#what-is-the-cleanup-report).

## Input assets

The `Cleanup operation` can be initiated from different places with different input assets:
- [Toolbar menu](how-to-run-commands#toolbar-menu) → checks for unused assets in your whole project
- [Folder Context Menu](how-to-run-commands#folder-context-menu) → checks for unused assets in the selected folders recursively
- [Asset Context Menu](how-to-run-commands#asset-context-menu) → checks for unused assets in the selected assets

## What is the Fast Cleanup

The `Fast Cleanup` is the fast version of the clenaup operation, it uses the same logic as the [Complex Cleanup](#what-is-a-complex-cleanup) but **relys on cached information to determine references between assets**.

## What is the Complex Cleanup

The `Complex Cleanup` is a more robust version of the cleanup operation, **it loads all assets into memory to ensure all asset references are up to date** but takes signafiacntly longer (especially on larger projects).

This version is currently disable due to engine crashes.
