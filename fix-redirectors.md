# What are Redirectors?

To facicilitate a smooth experience, when moving/renaming assets inside Unreal Engine a [redirector](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/Redirectors/) is created to ensure no references are broken.

This leaves the developers responsible for "fixing" those redirectors by performing the full operation when it's more convient.

To quickly fix all directors in your project, navigate the [Toolbar menu](how-to-run-commands#toolbar-menu) and start the `Cleanup redirectors` operation.

## Standard ways

Unreal provides multiple ways to fix redirectors explained [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/Redirectors/).
